32 bit ram module + ALU unit
blueprint circuit made on logicworks5

Requires
- a cpu unit
- a clock
- its own assemby language

to convert it into 32bit computer

meanwhile supports calculations around the scope of:

int a;
bool a2;
char a3;
int a4[3];
string a5;

a = a + b;
if( a > b );
a += a;
*a = *b;
a = 23;
if ( a == b );
c = a + b + c;
